## CAMPUS COURSE GUIDE
    Campus Course Guide is a web-based application that helps students to reach out to Teaching 
    Assistants (TAs), senior course mates and even lecturers for academic resources. This provides 
    students with the opportunity to obtain relevant and up to date course materials, slides, textbooks, 
    academic links, course references, past questions and YouTube videos. This will help students excel in 
    their academics and projects.
